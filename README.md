# AstralPatch

A quick little patch mod to fix a bug caused by Sponge overwritting the setBlockState method in Minecraft's chunk class.

This is only a temporary fix to resolve this issue until there is a better solution.

Tested with:

spongeforge-1.12.2-2768-7.1.4.jar
AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.10.jar
